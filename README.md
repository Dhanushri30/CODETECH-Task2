 OBJECTIVE
 This code creates a simple Library Management System in Python. Here's what it does:

Library Class:

__init__(): Initializes an empty list of books in the library.
add_book(book): Adds a new book to the library's list and confirms by printing a message.
display_books(): Shows all the books currently in the library. If there are no books, it informs the user.
delete_book(book): Removes a specified book from the library's list if it exists, and prints a confirmation message. If the book isn't found, it tells the user.
Library Menu:

The library_menu() function provides a menu with four options:
Add Book: Lets the user add a book to the library.
Display Books: Shows the list of all books in the library.
Delete Book: Allows the user to remove a book from the library.
Exit: Closes the program.
User Interaction:

The program continuously displays the menu and prompts the user to choose an option. It processes the user's choice by adding, displaying, or deleting books, or by exiting the program.
This simple system lets a user manage a small library by adding, viewing, and removing books from the collection.
